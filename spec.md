This project is going to be an app that has two main functions:



1. Deploying a website that allows users to log in, view a custom web page, access a database, and edit the database.
2. Interacting with an API for the "MASTER CLOCK ALLSYNC IQ ETHERNET 6 SIGNAL/2 CLOCK CIRCUITS"



The app will probably end up running on a Raspberry Pi.
